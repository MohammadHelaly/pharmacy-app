# pharmacy-app

Demo pharmacy management app built using React Native.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

-   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
-   npm or Yarn

## Installing the App

To install the app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/MohammadHelaly/pharmacy-app.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd pharmacy-app
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

## Running the App

To run the app on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Start the Expo development server using:

    ```
    npx expo start
    ```

    or

    ```
    npm start
    ```

2. Open the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android phone and scan the QR code printed in the terminal.
    - Alternatively, press `a` to run the app on an Android emulator, or `i` for running the app on an iOS simulator.

**Note:** the latest version of Expo Go on iOS will not support this app as this app was developed using Expo SDK 50. The most convenient method to run this app is to start an Android emulator from Android Studio, then in the terminal type `npm start` then press `a` when prompted.
